    Rewritten "My Why" Narrative:

        The story begins with a foundational passion for technology, leading to a business degree at Clemson.

        It will detail the transition from post-college consulting to a hands-on technical engineering role at Layer 3, which reignited that passion.

        The narrative will candidly address the transition to sales: the initial hesitation of leaving a tangible engineering role, balanced with the excitement of a new challenge.

        The story culminates in the moment of realizationâ€”when consistently exceeding quota and becoming the "go-to" person for new business proved the transition a resounding success.

        Card 1 (3D LiDAR): Focus on managing accounts for 3 of the world's top 10 companies, driving strategic value, and hunting new business in smart infrastructure.

        Card 2 (Layer 3): Detail the dual success as both a Systems Security Engineer and a Senior Account Executive. The narrative will center on the successful transition from engineering to sales, culminating in the "Top Salesperson in 2021" award (181% of quota).

        Card 3 (White Box Security): Emphasize startup experience and offensive cybersecurity expertise. The story will focus on building the business development practice from the ground up and landing the largest logo and revenue deal in the company's history.

    New "What Drives Me" Section:

        Technology Enthusiast: "Driven by the thrill of what's next, the endless possibilities new technology unlocks, and the challenge of making it accessible to everyone."
