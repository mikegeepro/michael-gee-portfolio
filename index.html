                    <h2>My Why</h2>
                    <p>My passion for technology has always been a constant, but my career path has been anything but a straight line. I started out with a business degree from Clemson, ready to tackle the world of consulting. But I soon found myself pulled back to my roots, taking a hands-on technical engineering role at Layer 3. Designing, building, and fixing things—seeing that tangible value—was where I felt at home.</p>
                    <p>Then came a new challenge. Our CEO "highly encouraged" me to make the jump into sales. Honestly, I was hesitant to leave the engineering world I enjoyed so much. But I was also excited by the opportunity to grow. That leap of faith paid off. The moment I realized I could truly succeed was when I began consistently exceeding my quota, becoming the go-to person for closing the toughest deals and breaking into new accounts. It taught me that my real passion isn't just *using* technology, but *connecting* it to people and solving real-world business problems.</p>
